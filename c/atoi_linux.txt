NAME
       atoi, atol, atoll - convert a string to an integer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int atoi(const char *nptr);
       long atol(const char *nptr);
       long long atoll(const char *nptr);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       atoll():
	   _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
	   _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
	   or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string  pointed
       to by nptr to int.  The behavior is the same as

	   strtol(nptr, NULL, 10);

       except that atoi() does not detect errors.

       The atol() and atoll() functions behave the same as atoi(), except that
       they convert the initial portion of the string to their return type  of
       long or long long.

RETURN VALUE
       The converted value.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The  atoi(),  atol(), and atoll() functions are thread-safe with excep‐
       tions.  These functions can be safely used  in  multithreaded  applica‐
       tions,  as long as setlocale(3) is not called to change the locale dur‐
       ing their execution.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, C99.   C89  and  POSIX.1-1996  include  the
       functions atoi() and atol() only.

NOTES
       Linux  libc  provided atoq() as an obsolete name for atoll(); atoq() is
       not provided by glibc.
