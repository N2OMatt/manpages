    class TarFile(__builtin__.object)
     |  The TarFile Class provides an interface to tar archives.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __enter__(self)
     |  
     |  __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
     |  
     |  __init__(self, name=None, mode='r', fileobj=None, format=None, tarinfo=None, dereference=None, ignore_zeros=None, encoding=None, errors=None, pax_headers=None, debug=None, errorlevel=None)
     |      Open an (uncompressed) tar archive `name'. `mode' is either 'r' to
     |      read from an existing archive, 'a' to append data to an existing
     |      file or 'w' to create a new file overwriting an existing one. `mode'
     |      defaults to 'r'.
     |      If `fileobj' is given, it is used for reading or writing data. If it
     |      can be determined, `mode' is overridden by `fileobj's mode.
     |      `fileobj' is not closed, when TarFile is closed.
     |  
     |  __iter__(self)
     |      Provide an iterator object.
     |  
     |  add(self, name, arcname=None, recursive=True, exclude=None, filter=None)
     |      Add the file `name' to the archive. `name' may be any type of file
     |      (directory, fifo, symbolic link, etc.). If given, `arcname'
     |      specifies an alternative name for the file in the archive.
     |      Directories are added recursively by default. This can be avoided by
     |      setting `recursive' to False. `exclude' is a function that should
     |      return True for each filename to be excluded. `filter' is a function
     |      that expects a TarInfo object argument and returns the changed
     |      TarInfo object, if it returns None the TarInfo object will be
     |      excluded from the archive.
     |  
     |  addfile(self, tarinfo, fileobj=None)
     |      Add the TarInfo object `tarinfo' to the archive. If `fileobj' is
     |      given, tarinfo.size bytes are read from it and added to the archive.
     |      You can create TarInfo objects using gettarinfo().
     |      On Windows platforms, `fileobj' should always be opened with mode
     |      'rb' to avoid irritation about the file size.
     |  
     |  chmod(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Set file permissions of targetpath according to tarinfo.
     |  
     |  chown(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Set owner of targetpath according to tarinfo.
     |  
     |  close(self)
     |      Close the TarFile. In write-mode, two finishing zero blocks are
     |      appended to the archive.
     |  
     |  extract(self, member, path='')
     |      Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory,
     |      using its full name. Its file information is extracted as accurately
     |      as possible. `member' may be a filename or a TarInfo object. You can
     |      specify a different directory using `path'.
     |  
     |  extractall(self, path='.', members=None)
     |      Extract all members from the archive to the current working
     |      directory and set owner, modification time and permissions on
     |      directories afterwards. `path' specifies a different directory
     |      to extract to. `members' is optional and must be a subset of the
     |      list returned by getmembers().
     |  
     |  extractfile(self, member)
     |      Extract a member from the archive as a file object. `member' may be
     |      a filename or a TarInfo object. If `member' is a regular file, a
     |      file-like object is returned. If `member' is a link, a file-like
     |      object is constructed from the link's target. If `member' is none of
     |      the above, None is returned.
     |      The file-like object is read-only and provides the following
     |      methods: read(), readline(), readlines(), seek() and tell()
     |  
     |  getmember(self, name)
     |      Return a TarInfo object for member `name'. If `name' can not be
     |      found in the archive, KeyError is raised. If a member occurs more
     |      than once in the archive, its last occurrence is assumed to be the
     |      most up-to-date version.
     |  
     |  getmembers(self)
     |      Return the members of the archive as a list of TarInfo objects. The
     |      list has the same order as the members in the archive.
     |  
     |  getnames(self)
     |      Return the members of the archive as a list of their names. It has
     |      the same order as the list returned by getmembers().
     |  
     |  gettarinfo(self, name=None, arcname=None, fileobj=None)
     |      Create a TarInfo object for either the file `name' or the file
     |      object `fileobj' (using os.fstat on its file descriptor). You can
     |      modify some of the TarInfo's attributes before you add it using
     |      addfile(). If given, `arcname' specifies an alternative name for the
     |      file in the archive.
     |  
     |  list(self, verbose=True)
     |      Print a table of contents to sys.stdout. If `verbose' is False, only
     |      the names of the members are printed. If it is True, an `ls -l'-like
     |      output is produced.
     |  
     |  makedev(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Make a character or block device called targetpath.
     |  
     |  makedir(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Make a directory called targetpath.
     |  
     |  makefifo(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Make a fifo called targetpath.
     |  
     |  makefile(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Make a file called targetpath.
     |  
     |  makelink(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Make a (symbolic) link called targetpath. If it cannot be created
     |      (platform limitation), we try to make a copy of the referenced file
     |      instead of a link.
     |  
     |  makeunknown(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Make a file from a TarInfo object with an unknown type
     |      at targetpath.
     |  
     |  next(self)
     |      Return the next member of the archive as a TarInfo object, when
     |      TarFile is opened for reading. Return None if there is no more
     |      available.
     |  
     |  utime(self, tarinfo, targetpath)
     |      Set modification time of targetpath according to tarinfo.
