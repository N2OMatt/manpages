DESCRIPTION
    The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling. The
    builtin open function is defined in this module.
    
    At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
    defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
    separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
    allowed to raise an IOError if they do not support a given operation.
    
    Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
    writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
    an interface to OS files.
    
    BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
    subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
    streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
    BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
    streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.
    
    Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
    of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
    interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
    is a in-memory stream for text.
    
    Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
    of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.
    
    data:
    
    DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE
    
       An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered
       I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if
       possible.

    class BufferedRWPair(_BufferedIOBase)
     |  A buffered reader and writer object together.
     |  
     |  A buffered reader object and buffered writer object put together to
     |  form a sequential IO object that can read and write. This is typically
     |  used with a socket or two-way pipe.
     |  
     |  reader and writer are RawIOBase objects that are readable and
     |  writeable respectively. If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to
     |  DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.

     |  detach(...)
     |      Disconnect this buffer from its underlying raw stream and return it.
     |      
     |      After the raw stream has been detached, the buffer is in an unusable
     |      state.

     |  
     |  fileno(...)
     |      Returns underlying file descriptor if one exists.
     |      
     |      An IOError is raised if the IO object does not use a file descriptor.
     |  
     |  next(...)
     |      x.next() -> the next value, or raise StopIteration
     |  
     |  readline(...)
     |      Read and return a line from the stream.
     |      
     |      If limit is specified, at most limit bytes will be read.
     |      
     |      The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
     |      files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
     |      terminator(s) recognized.
     |  
     |  readlines(...)
     |      Return a list of lines from the stream.
     |      
     |      hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more
     |      lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all
     |      lines so far exceeds hint.
     |  
     |  seek(...)
     |      Change stream position.
     |      
     |      Change the stream position to the given byte offset. The offset is
     |      interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.  Values
     |      for whence are:
     |      
     |      * 0 -- start of stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
     |      * 1 -- current stream position; offset may be negative
     |      * 2 -- end of stream; offset is usually negative
     |      
     |      Return the new absolute position.
     |  
     |  seekable(...)
     |      Return whether object supports random access.
     |      
     |      If False, seek(), tell() and truncate() will raise IOError.
     |      This method may need to do a test seek().
     |  
     |  tell(...)
     |      Return current stream position.
     |  
     |  truncate(...)
     |      Truncate file to size bytes.
     |      
     |      File pointer is left unchanged.  Size defaults to the current IO
     |      position as reported by tell().  Returns the new size.
     |  
     |  writelines(...)
    
    class BufferedRandom(_BufferedIOBase)
     |  A buffered interface to random access streams.
     |  
     |  The constructor creates a reader and writer for a seekable stream,
     |  raw, given in the first argument. If the buffer_size is omitted it
     |  defaults to DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE. max_buffer_size isn't used anymore.

     |      Read and return up to n bytes.
     |      
     |      If the argument is omitted, None, or negative, reads and
     |      returns all data until EOF.
     |      
     |      If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is
     |      not 'interactive', multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy
     |      the byte count (unless EOF is reached first).  But for
     |      interactive raw streams (as well as sockets and pipes), at most
     |      one raw read will be issued, and a short result does not imply
     |      that EOF is imminent.
     |      
     |      Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
     |      
     |      Returns None if the underlying raw stream was open in non-blocking
     |      mode and no data is available at the moment.
     |  
     |  read1(...)
     |      Read and return up to n bytes, with at most one read() call

     |      
     |      If the size argument is negative, read until EOF is reached.
     |      Return an empty string at EOF.
     |

     |      
     |      If the size argument is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
     |      Return an empty string at EOF.
     |  
     |  readable(...)
     |      readable() -> bool. Returns True if the IO object can be read.
     |  
     |  readinto(...)
     |      readinto(bytearray) -> int.  Read up to len(b) bytes into b.
     |      
     |      Returns number of bytes read (0 for EOF), or None if the object
     |      is set not to block as has no data to read.
     |  
     |  readline(...)
     |      readline([size]) -> next line from the file, as a string.
     |      
     |      Retain newline.  A non-negative size argument limits the maximum
     |      number of bytes to return (an incomplete line may be returned then).
     |      Return an empty string at EOF.
     |  
     |  readlines(...)
     |      readlines([size]) -> list of strings, each a line from the file.
     |      
     |      Call readline() repeatedly and return a list of the lines so read.
     |      The optional size argument, if given, is an approximate bound on the
     |      total number of bytes in the lines returned.
     |  
     |  seek(...)
     |      seek(pos, whence=0) -> int.  Change stream position.
     |      
     |      Seek to byte offset pos relative to position indicated by whence:
     |           0  Start of stream (the default).  pos should be >= 0;

     |  
     |  newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '',
     |  '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as follows:
     |  
     |  * On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
     |    enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
     |    these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
     |    caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
     |    endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
     |    the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
     |    string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
     |  
     |  * On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
     |    translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
     |    newline is '', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the
     |    other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated to
     |    the given string.
     |  
     |  If line_buffering is True, a call to flush is implied when a call to
     |  write contains a newline character.

FUNCTIONS
    open(...)
        Open file and return a stream.  Raise IOError upon failure.
        
        file is either a text or byte string giving the name (and the path
        if the file isn't in the current working directory) of the file to
        be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be
        wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the
        returned I/O object is closed, unless closefd is set to False.)
        
        mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file
        is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text
        mode.  Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if
        it already exists), and 'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems,
        means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the
        current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the
        encoding used is platform dependent. (For reading and writing raw
        bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available
        modes are:

        'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
        'b'       binary mode
        't'       text mode (default)
        '+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
        'U'       universal newline mode (for backwards compatibility; unneeded
                  for new code)
        ========= ===============================================================
        
        The default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text). For binary random
        access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes, while
        'r+b' opens the file without truncation.
        
        Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,
        even when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in
        binary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument) return contents as
        bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when
        't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are
        returned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a
        platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.
        
        buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy.
        Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select
        line buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate
        the size of a fixed-size chunk buffer.  When no buffering argument is
        given, the default buffering policy works as follows:
        
        * Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer
          is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's
          "block size" and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.
          On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.
        
        * "Interactive" text files (files for which isatty() returns True)
          use line buffering.  Other text files use the policy described above
          for binary files.
        
        encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the
        file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is
        platform dependent, but any encoding supported by Python can be
        passed.  See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.
        
        errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding errors are to
        be handled---this argument should not be used in binary mode. Pass
        'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error
        (the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore
        errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)
        See the documentation for codecs.register for a list of the permitted
        encoding error strings.
        
        newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text
        mode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as
        follows:
        
        * On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
          enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
          these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
          caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
          endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
          the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
          string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
        
        * On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
          translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
          newline is '', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the
          other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated to
          the given string.
        
        If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
        when the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given
        and must be True in that case.
        
        open() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and
        through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing
        are performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
        'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open
        a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary
        mode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary
        modes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns
        a BufferedRandom.
        
        It is also possible to use a string or bytearray as a file for both
        reading and writing. For strings StringIO can be used like a file
        opened in a text mode, and for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file
        opened in a binary mode.
