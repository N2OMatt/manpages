Help on module glob:

NAME
    glob - Filename globbing utility.

FILE
    /usr/lib/python2.7/glob.py

MODULE DOCS
    http://docs.python.org/library/glob

FUNCTIONS
    glob(pathname)
        Return a list of paths matching a pathname pattern.
        
        The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
        fnmatch. However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
        dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
        patterns.
    
    iglob(pathname)
        Return an iterator which yields the paths matching a pathname pattern.
        
        The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
