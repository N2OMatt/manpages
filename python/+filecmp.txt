    filecmp - Utilities for comparing files and directories.

MODULE DOCS

DESCRIPTION
    Classes:
        dircmp
    
    Functions:
        cmp(f1, f2, shallow=1) -> int
        cmpfiles(a, b, common) -> ([], [], [])

CLASSES
    dircmp
    
    class dircmp
     |  A class that manages the comparison of 2 directories.
     |  
     |  dircmp(a,b,ignore=None,hide=None)
     |    A and B are directories.
     |    IGNORE is a list of names to ignore,
     |      defaults to ['RCS', 'CVS', 'tags'].
     |    HIDE is a list of names to hide,
     |      defaults to [os.curdir, os.pardir].
     |  
     |  High level usage:
     |    x = dircmp(dir1, dir2)
     |    x.report() -> prints a report on the differences between dir1 and dir2
     |     or
     |    x.report_partial_closure() -> prints report on differences between dir1
     |          and dir2, and reports on common immediate subdirectories.
     |    x.report_full_closure() -> like report_partial_closure,
     |          but fully recursive.
     |  
     |  Attributes:
     |   left_list, right_list: The files in dir1 and dir2,
     |      filtered by hide and ignore.
     |   common: a list of names in both dir1 and dir2.
     |   left_only, right_only: names only in dir1, dir2.
     |   common_dirs: subdirectories in both dir1 and dir2.
     |   common_files: files in both dir1 and dir2.
     |   common_funny: names in both dir1 and dir2 where the type differs between
     |      dir1 and dir2, or the name is not stat-able.
     |   same_files: list of identical files.
     |   diff_files: list of filenames which differ.
     |   funny_files: list of files which could not be compared.
     |   subdirs: a dictionary of dircmp objects, keyed by names in common_dirs.

FUNCTIONS
    cmp(f1, f2, shallow=1)
        Compare two files.
        
        Arguments:
        
        f1 -- First file name
        
        f2 -- Second file name
        
        shallow -- Just check stat signature (do not read the files).
                   defaults to 1.
        
        Return value:
        
        True if the files are the same, False otherwise.
        
        This function uses a cache for past comparisons and the results,
        with a cache invalidation mechanism relying on stale signatures.
    
    cmpfiles(a, b, common, shallow=1)
        Compare common files in two directories.
        
        a, b -- directory names
        common -- list of file names found in both directories
        shallow -- if true, do comparison based solely on stat() information
        
        Returns a tuple of three lists:
          files that compare equal
          files that are different
          filenames that aren't regular files.
