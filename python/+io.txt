DESCRIPTION
    The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling. The
    builtin open function is defined in this module.
    
    At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
    defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
    separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
    allowed to raise an IOError if they do not support a given operation.
    
    Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
    writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
    an interface to OS files.
    
    BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
    subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
    streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
    BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
    streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.
    
    Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
    of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
    interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
    is a in-memory stream for text.
    
    Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
    of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.
    
    data:
    
    DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE
    
       An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered
       I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if
       possible.

    class BufferedIOBase(_io._BufferedIOBase, IOBase)
     |  Base class for buffered IO objects.
     |  
     |  The main difference with RawIOBase is that the read() method
     |  supports omitting the size argument, and does not have a default
     |  implementation that defers to readinto().
     |  
     |  In addition, read(), readinto() and write() may raise
     |  BlockingIOError if the underlying raw stream is in non-blocking
     |  mode and not ready; unlike their raw counterparts, they will never
     |  return None.
     |  
     |  A typical implementation should not inherit from a RawIOBase
     |  implementation, but wrap one.

     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Methods inherited from _io._BufferedIOBase:
     |  
     |  detach(...)
     |      Disconnect this buffer from its underlying raw stream and return it.
     |      
     |      After the raw stream has been detached, the buffer is in an unusable
     |      state.
     |  
     |  read(...)
     |      Read and return up to n bytes.
     |      
     |      If the argument is omitted, None, or negative, reads and
     |      returns all data until EOF.
     |      
     |      If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is
     |      not 'interactive', multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy
     |      the byte count (unless EOF is reached first).  But for
     |      interactive raw streams (as well as sockets and pipes), at most
     |      one raw read will be issued, and a short result does not imply
     |      that EOF is imminent.
     |      
     |      Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
     |      
     |      Returns None if the underlying raw stream was open in non-blocking
     |      mode and no data is available at the moment.
     |  
     |  read1(...)
     |      Read and return up to n bytes, with at most one read() call
     |      to the underlying raw stream. A short result does not imply
     |      that EOF is imminent.
     |      
     |      Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
     |  
     |  readinto(...)
     |  
     |  write(...)
     |      Write the given buffer to the IO stream.
     |      
     |      Returns the number of bytes written, which is never less than
     |      len(b).
     |      
     |      Raises BlockingIOError if the buffer is full and the
     |      underlying raw stream cannot accept more data at the moment.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data and other attributes inherited from IOBase:
     |  
     |  __metaclass__ = <class 'abc.ABCMeta'>
     |      Metaclass for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).
     |      
     |      Use this metaclass to create an ABC.  An ABC can be subclassed
     |      directly, and then acts as a mix-in class.  You can also register
     |      unrelated concrete classes (even built-in classes) and unrelated
     |      ABCs as 'virtual subclasses' -- these and their descendants will
     |      be considered subclasses of the registering ABC by the built-in
     |      issubclass() function, but the registering ABC won't show up in
     |      their MRO (Method Resolution Order) nor will method
     |      implementations defined by the registering ABC be callable (not
     |      even via super()).

     |      x.__iter__() <==> iter(x)
     |  
     |  close(...)
     |      Flush and close the IO object.
     |      
     |      This method has no effect if the file is already closed.
     |  
     |  fileno(...)
     |      Returns underlying file descriptor if one exists.
     |      
     |      An IOError is raised if the IO object does not use a file descriptor.
     |  
     |  flush(...)
     |      Flush write buffers, if applicable.
     |      
     |      This is not implemented for read-only and non-blocking streams.
     |  
     |  isatty(...)
     |      Return whether this is an 'interactive' stream.
     |      
     |      Return False if it can't be determined.
     |  
     |  next(...)
     |      x.next() -> the next value, or raise StopIteration
     |  
     |  readable(...)
     |      Return whether object was opened for reading.
     |      
     |      If False, read() will raise IOError.
     |  
     |  readline(...)
     |      Read and return a line from the stream.
     |      
     |      If limit is specified, at most limit bytes will be read.
     |      
     |      The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
     |      files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
     |      terminator(s) recognized.
     |  
     |  readlines(...)
     |      Return a list of lines from the stream.
     |      
     |      hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more
     |      lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all
     |      lines so far exceeds hint.
     |  
     |  seek(...)
     |      Change stream position.
     |      
     |      Change the stream position to the given byte offset. The offset is
     |      interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.  Values
     |      for whence are:
     |      
     |      * 0 -- start of stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
     |      * 1 -- current stream position; offset may be negative
     |      * 2 -- end of stream; offset is usually negative
     |      
     |      Return the new absolute position.
     |  
     |  seekable(...)
     |      Return whether object supports random access.
     |      
     |      If False, seek(), tell() and truncate() will raise IOError.
     |      This method may need to do a test seek().
     |  
     |  tell(...)
     |      Return current stream position.
     |  
     |  truncate(...)
     |      Truncate file to size bytes.
     |      
     |      File pointer is left unchanged.  Size defaults to the current IO
     |      position as reported by tell().  Returns the new size.
     |  
     |  writable(...)
     |      Return whether object was opened for writing.
     |

     |      If the argument is omitted, None, or negative, reads and
     |      returns all data until EOF.
     |      
     |      If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is
     |      not 'interactive', multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy
     |      the byte count (unless EOF is reached first).  But for
     |      interactive raw streams (as well as sockets and pipes), at most
     |      one raw read will be issued, and a short result does not imply
     |      that EOF is imminent.
     |      
     |      Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
     |      
     |      Returns None if the underlying raw stream was open in non-blocking

     |  readline(...)
     |      readline([size]) -> next line from the file, as a string.
     |      
     |      Retain newline.  A non-negative size argument limits the maximum

     |      Call readline() repeatedly and return a list of the lines so read.
     |      The optional size argument, if given, is an approximate bound on the

    class IOBase(_io._IOBase)
     |  The abstract base class for all I/O classes, acting on streams of
     |  bytes. There is no public constructor.
     |  
     |  This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
     |  derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
     |  represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.
     |  
     |  Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
     |  their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
     |  consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
     |  may raise a IOError when operations they do not support are called.
     |  
     |  The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
     |  bytes. bytearrays are accepted too, and in some cases (such as
     |  readinto) needed. Text I/O classes work with str data.

     |  Note that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),

     |  IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
     |  that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
     |  stream.
     |  
     |  IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
     |  fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:
     |

FUNCTIONS
    open(...)
        Open file and return a stream.  Raise IOError upon failure.
        
        file is either a text or byte string giving the name (and the path
        if the file isn't in the current working directory) of the file to
        be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be
        wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the
        returned I/O object is closed, unless closefd is set to False.)
        
        mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file
        is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text
        mode.  Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if
        it already exists), and 'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems,
        means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the
        current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the
        encoding used is platform dependent. (For reading and writing raw
        bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available
        modes are:
        
        ========= ===============================================================
        Character Meaning
        --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
        'r'       open for reading (default)
        'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
        'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
        'b'       binary mode
        't'       text mode (default)
        '+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
        'U'       universal newline mode (for backwards compatibility; unneeded
                  for new code)
        ========= ===============================================================
        
        The default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text). For binary random
        access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes, while
        'r+b' opens the file without truncation.
        
        Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,
        even when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in
        binary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument) return contents as
        bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when
        't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are
        returned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a
        platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.
        
        buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy.
        Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select
        line buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate
        the size of a fixed-size chunk buffer.  When no buffering argument is
        given, the default buffering policy works as follows:
        
        * Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer
          is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's
          "block size" and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.
          On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.
        
        * "Interactive" text files (files for which isatty() returns True)
          use line buffering.  Other text files use the policy described above
          for binary files.
        
        encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the
        file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is
        platform dependent, but any encoding supported by Python can be
        passed.  See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.
        
        errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding errors are to
        be handled---this argument should not be used in binary mode. Pass
        'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error
        (the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore
        errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)
        See the documentation for codecs.register for a list of the permitted
        encoding error strings.
        
        newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text
        mode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as
        follows:
        
        * On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
          enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
          these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
          caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
          endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
          the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
          string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
        
        * On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
          translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
          newline is '', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the
          other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated to
          the given string.
        
        If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
        when the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given
        and must be True in that case.
        
        open() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and
        through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing
        are performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
        'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open
        a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary
        mode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary
        modes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns
        a BufferedRandom.
        
        It is also possible to use a string or bytearray as a file for both
        reading and writing. For strings StringIO can be used like a file
        opened in a text mode, and for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file
        opened in a binary mode.
